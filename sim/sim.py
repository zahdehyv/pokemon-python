sim.py

This file has the methods that would be called by the user of the simulator.
First one must create a new battle and then one can either call run() which
will run the battle from start to finish without input from players, or
you can call choose for each player and do_turn do execute a single turn.

The caller of the simulator has access to the Battle dataclass which has
all the information about the battle. Its fields should never be edited and
Its methods should never be called. The caller has access so they can view
the state of the battle. No info is hidden.

    To be called once both sides have made their decisions.
    Updates the game state according to the decisions. This method
    is the meat of the simulator, some of the logic is separated
    to other methods but the idea is as follows:

        * update fields that need updating before any 'actions' happen
        * build and then execute all 'actions' for the turn
        * update fields that need updating after all 'actions'
            eg. burn damage, weather...
        * check if someone won the game on this turn
        * update the request for new decisions from player/ai

    Note: Pseudo turns exist for when either player needs to throw out
    another pokemon due to fainting
