# Pokémon Battle Simulation with AI

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to **evolve Pokémon** using evolutionary algorithms, specifically through the implementation of ES-HyperNEAT (Evolvable-Substrate HyperNEAT). This allows the Pokémon to adapt and improve their battle strategies over time by evolving neural networks that control their behavior during combat.

By achieving this goal, the project aims to explore the effectiveness of various strategies employed by the evolved Pokémon and to analyze their performance in simulated battles.
